Making money via AI MEVbot attack opportunities (GPT-4 source) (AUDITED)!

**The officially licensed jaredfromsubway.eth mevbot source code**

**UPDATE 05/01/2023:** I've announced that I will be removing the open source version of my MevBot on **05/20/2023** in light of imminent network upgrades to mitigate MEV arbitrage generation, probably caused by releasing this. We will be providing a premium version of the service in the future with plans beginning at **.5 eth**.

-----

Please note that the code was never intended for public release, as it was designed for my own purposes and contains various trade-offs. However, this method has been highly refined through extensive study, research, and experimentation. 

Never ever did I plan to release this publicly, lest I "leak my alpha". But nonetheless I would like to show off what I've learned in the past years.

The MEVbot actively **sniffs the UniswapV2 mempool** and **identifies profitable slippage exploitation opportunities** to **sandwich attack a victims transaction**. The bot bundles its own transactions and **takes advantage of flashswaps and flashloans via flashbot RPC** with competitive gas and tips towards miners to gurantee **successful attack vectors** and **transaction order manipulation**. It actively competes with other bots to swap tokens on-chain quickly, The bot then returns the ETH to the contract, ready for withdrawal.

This bot does all that, and 99.9% faster than other bots.

'But ser, there are open source bots that do the same'

 -Yes, indeed there are. Mine was the first, however. And I **still** outperform them. Reading their articles makes me giggle, as I went through their same pains and from one bot builder to another, I feel these guys. <3

'Wen increase aggressiveness ?'

 -I've spent a year obsessing about this, I have a list of target endpoints that I know other bots use, which I could flood with requests in order to make them lose up to 5 seconds of reaction time and gain an edge over them.

..Personal journey in this

'What did I learn?'

 -MEV, Frontrunning, EIP-1559, "[The Dark Forest](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest/) 🌲💡", various tricks to exploit more web3 and web2 kind of architectures. And all sorts of ins and outs about Unsiwap and DEX

'So why stop?'

 -I've made some profits from this but now I'm using more efficient commercial and private methods, -I'm ready to share what I've learned so devs don't need to go through the same pain.

Towards the end I kept getting outcompeted by this individual:

https://etherscan.io/address/0x55659ddee6cb013c35301f6f3cc8482de857ea8e

If this is you, I'd like to congratulate you on your badassery. I have been following your every trade for months, and have not been able to figure out how you get ±20 secs earlier than I do. What a fucking chad.

But I will give you some competition.(ㆆ_ㆆ)

The bot will utilize the entire balance to transact arbitrage

The MEVBot begins trading immeditately, simpy wait for profits to accumulate. 

### ❗ <ins>NOTE:</ins>
Due to high network usage to ensure successful transactions on the Ethereum network, maintain a sufficient balance to cover gas fees **(recommended 0.1 - 0.2 ETH)**.

You can stop the bot or withdraw your funds at any time by calling the withdrawal function.
